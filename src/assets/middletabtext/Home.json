  "text": "Welcome to my corner of our global interconncted network of computers! I hope this landing page seems familiar to you because yes, I did draw some heavy inspirations from that one IDE. Considering the amount of hours I spend working in VSCode day in and day out, there was never going to be another option for my UI... I use this site for both professional use and as a way to showcase neat developer related topics. Onwards to my next line of code! "
